A cool 3x3 macropad I made with an OLED and encoder. I'm going to try to use it as a controller for QLAB and maybe also as a general purpose macropad

## Features
- Currently being used as QLAB controller, a software that controlls SFX for live theatre
- Has buttons for GO, Panic, Pause, Resume, Audition, Next/Last Cue, and Open/Close group cues
- Encoder is bound to volume and can be pressed to mute
